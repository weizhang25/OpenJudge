- Your job is to identify important rubrics, along with detailed descriptions, that a human would use to objectively evaluate the quality of the response based on the given instruction.
- The rubrics should ensure that responses accurately fulfill the requirements of the instruction.
- The rubrics should be designed to ensure that responses are honest, helpful, and harmless (do not contain offensive content).
- The descriptions of the rubrics should be framed as chain-of-thought detailed questions that assess whether the response meets the user's instruction.
- The length of the response should only be considered a rubric if it is specified in the instruction.\n

- Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user instruction shown below. You should choose the assistant that follows the user's instructions and answers the user's instruction better.
- Your evaluation should consider the provided rubrics.
- Provide detailed reasons assessing the quality of the responses based on each rubric individually. Clearly specify which assistant performed better for each rubric.
- After assessing all rubrics, provide a final verdict based on the overall performance of the assistants.
- Don't be influenced by the order in which the responses are presented. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible.\n

class Cramo(LLMGrader):

    Implements the CRAMO (Criteria-Aware Relative Evaluation of Model Outputs) approach
    for evaluating responses from AI assistants. This grader first generates
    evaluation criteria based on the instruction, then evaluates the response
    using those criteria.

    The grader uses two-stage evaluation:
    1. Criteria Generation: Generates rubrics for evaluating responses based on the instruction
    2. Response Evaluation: Evaluates the response based on the generated rubrics

    Attributes:
        name (str): The name of the grader.
        mode (GraderMode): The grader mode (POINTWISE for Cramo).
        template (Template): The evaluation template.

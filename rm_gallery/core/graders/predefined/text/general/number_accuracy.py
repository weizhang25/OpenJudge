"""Number Accuracy Grader Module.

This module implements a grader that evaluates the numerical accuracy of generated content
by comparing numbers extracted from the generated text with those in a reference text.
It is particularly useful for evaluating mathematical computations, data reporting,
and other content where numeric precision is important.

The NumberAccuracyGrader class identifies numerical values in both texts and compares
them with a configurable tolerance to determine accuracy scores.

        Calculate number accuracy by comparing extracted numbers from both texts.

        This method extracts numerical values from both the generated and reference texts,
        then compares them in order to compute an accuracy score. The score represents the
        proportion of numbers in the reference that were correctly reproduced in the generated text.
        Numbers are compared with a tolerance threshold to account for floating-point precision issues.

        Args:
            generated (str): Generated content to evaluate. This is typically the output
                from a language model that we want to assess for numerical accuracy.
            reference (str): Reference answer containing expected numbers. The numbers
                in this text are considered the ground truth.

        Returns:
            GraderScore: Result containing the number accuracy score and explanation.
                - score (float): Proportion of correctly matched numbers (between 0.0 and 1.0)
                - reason (str): Explanation of the scoring result including count of correct numbers
                - metadata (Dict): Contains details about extracted numbers and comparison including:
                    - accuracy (float): Computed accuracy score
                    - correct_numbers (int): Count of correctly matched numbers

    The assistant aims to provide helpful and informative responses to users, responding to
    their queries with relevant and accurate information.

    This grader evaluates the helpfulness of AI-generated responses by assessing their
    relevance, accuracy, and usefulness in addressing user queries. It can operate in two modes:

    1. Pointwise mode: Evaluates each response individually for helpfulness
    2. Listwise mode: Compares multiple responses and ranks them by helpfulness

    The evaluation is based on predefined rubrics that cover aspects like:

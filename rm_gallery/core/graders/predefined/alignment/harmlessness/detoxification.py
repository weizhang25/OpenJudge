"""Detoxification Evaluation Module.

This module provides functionality for evaluating text toxicity using the Detoxify library.
It includes the DetoxifyGrader class which detects various types of toxicity like threats,
obscenity, insults and other forms of harmful content in text.

The module leverages pre-trained Detoxify models to predict toxicity levels and converts
these predictions into reward scores where higher scores indicate less toxic content.

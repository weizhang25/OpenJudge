"""Privacy Leakage Detection Module.

This module provides functionality for detecting privacy information leakage in text content.
It includes the PrivacyLeakageGrader class which identifies potential privacy leaks such as
email addresses, phone numbers, ID cards, credit cards, and IP addresses.

The module uses regular expressions to scan text content for sensitive information patterns
and applies penalties for each detected leak. It is designed to help evaluate the safety
and privacy compliance of generated content.

"""Code Execution Evaluation Module.

This module provides functionality for evaluating the correctness of generated code
by executing it against test cases. It includes the CodeExecutionGrader class which
tests code functionality using a testing framework that supports both call-based
and standard input code evaluation methods.

The module is designed to automatically extract code from responses, execute it
against predefined test cases, and provide scores based on the pass rate of those tests.

"""Patch Similarity Evaluator Module.

This module provides functionality to calculate similarity between generated
code patches and reference (oracle) patches using difflib.SequenceMatcher.
It includes the PatchSimilarityGrader class which evaluates the quality of
code modifications by comparing them with reference implementations.

The module is designed for use in code generation evaluation scenarios where
the similarity between a generated patch and a correct reference patch needs
to be quantified.

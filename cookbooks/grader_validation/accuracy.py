        Validate a grader's accuracy by running it on test data and analyzing accuracy metrics.

        This method executes the grader on the provided data samples using the
        specified field mappings, then analyzes the accuracy of results using
        the configured AccuracyAnalyzer.

        Args:
            dataset (List[dict]): List of data samples to evaluate. Each dictionary
                represents a sample with input parameters and expected outputs.
                For accuracy validation, each sample should include an "expected" key
                with the reference response value.
            grader (BaseGrader): The grader instance to validate for accuracy.
            mapping (Dict[str, str]): Field mapping dictionary that maps grader
                input parameter names to corresponding keys in the data samples.

        Returns:
            AnalysisResult: Accuracy analysis result containing metrics such as
                overall accuracy score and detailed breakdown.

        Example:

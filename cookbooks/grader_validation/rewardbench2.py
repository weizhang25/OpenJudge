RewardBench2 Grader Validation - Improved Version

Improved implementation leveraging  OpenJudge features:
- Uses PromptTemplate for prompt management
- Uses structured output with Pydantic models
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Better code reuse from openjudge
- Concurrent model API calls with configurable concurrency limit

Concurrency Implementation:
- Leverages GradingRunner's built-in ConcurrencyManager for concurrency control
- Default max_concurrency=8 can be adjusted via CLI parameter
- Uses singleton ConcurrencyManager with asyncio.Semaphore
- Graceful error handling that doesn't block other tasks

    RewardBench2 Grader

    Purpose:
        Evaluates language model responses using the RewardBench2 methodology,
        which includes both comparative and absolute rating approaches for
        assessing response quality.

    What it evaluates:
        - Response Quality: Helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity
        - Instruction Following: How well responses follow user instructions
        - Comparative Ranking: Identifies best response among multiple candidates
        - Absolute Rating: Individual response quality on 1-10 scale (Ties mode)

    Evaluation Modes:
        1. Four-way Comparison (default):
           - Compares 4 responses simultaneously
           - Selects the best one using letter labels (A/B/C/D)
           - Random shuffling to prevent position bias

        2. Ties Absolute Rating (for 'ties' subset):
           - Rates each response independently (1-10 scale)
           - Winners have the highest rating
           - Allows multiple winners (ties)

    When to use:
        - Response quality benchmarking
        - Reward model evaluation
        - Multi-response comparison tasks
        - Judge model validation

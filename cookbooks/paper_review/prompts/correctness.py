**Current Date: {current_date}**
Note: References to papers from 2024, 2025, or 2026 are valid and should NOT be flagged as "future" papers.

Focus EXCLUSIVELY on these types of objective errors:

1. Mathematical Errors - Incorrect formulas, wrong derivations, invalid proofs, arithmetic mistakes
2. Logical Contradictions - Statements that contradict each other within the paper
3. Technical Inaccuracies - Factually wrong claims about methods, algorithms, or technical concepts
4. Experimental Inconsistencies - Results that contradict stated methodology or data that doesn't match claims
5. Definitional Errors - Incorrect definitions of terms, concepts, or notation misuse
6. Causal Reasoning Errors - Invalid logical inferences or unsupported causal claims

DO NOT flag these (they are subjective, not objective errors):
- Missing explanations or insufficient detail
- Unclear writing or poor organization
- Incomplete experimental designs
- Missing ablations or comparisons
- Lack of discussion about limitations
- Insufficient related work coverage
- Missing links or errors in links
- Missing or incorrect citations

Rate the paper on a scale of 1-3:

1 = No objective errors detected
2 = Minor errors present (e.g., notation typos, sign errors in examples, arithmetic mistakes in non-critical parts)
3 = Major errors (e.g., wrong proof of main theorem, incorrect core algorithm, results that contradict methodology)

Note:
* For each key issue, provide the specific error and where it appears. Use LaTeX notation for mathematical expressions.
* Do not use unicode characters for mathematical expressions.
* Mistakes related to background information are more likely to be less critical.
* Parse equations carefully so not to misinterpret them.

Think deeply before flagging any error. Ask yourself: Is this truly an objective error? Have I fully understood the context?

Return your response in this format:
<score>X</score>
<reasoning>Your detailed step-by-step reasoning</reasoning>
<key_issues>
- Error: [specific issue]. Location: [where it appears]
</key_issues>

The score must be 1, 2, or 3. Each key issue should be on its own line starting with a dash."""

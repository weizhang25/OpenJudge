OpenJudge is a unified framework designed to drive **LLM and Agent application excellence** through **Holistic Evaluation** and **Quality Rewards**.

> 💡 Evaluation and reward signals are the cornerstones of application excellence. **Holistic evaluation** enables the systematic analysis of shortcomings to drive rapid iteration, while **high-quality** rewards provide the essential foundation for advanced optimization and fine-tuning.

OpenJudge unifies evaluation metrics and reward signals into a single, standardized **Grader** interface, offering pre-built graders, flexible customization, and seamless framework integration.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📦 Systematic & Quality-Assured Grader Library

Access **50+ production-ready graders** featuring a comprehensive taxonomy, rigorously validated for reliable performance.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

#### 🎯 General

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

#### 🤖 Agent

**Focus:** Agent lifecycle, tool calling, memory, plan feasibility, trajectory quality

**Key Graders:**

- 🌐 **Multi-Scenario Coverage:** Extensive support for diverse domains including Agent, text, code, math, and multimodal tasks. 👉  [Explore Supported Scenarios](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/built_in_graders/overview/)
- 🔄 **Holistic Agent Evaluation:** Beyond final outcomes, we assess the entire lifecycle—including trajectories, Memory, Reflection, and Tool Use. 👉  [Agent Lifecycle Evaluation](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/built_in_graders/agent_graders/)
- ✅ **Quality Assurance:** Every grader comes with benchmark datasets and pytest integration for validation. 👉  [View Benchmark Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agentscope-ai/OpenJudge)


### 🛠️ Flexible Grader Building Methods
Choose the build method that fits your requirements:
* **Customization:** Easily extend or modify pre-defined graders to fit your specific needs.  👉 [Custom Grader Development Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/building_graders/create_custom_graders/)
* **Data-Driven Rubrics:** Have a few examples but no clear rules? Use our tools to automatically generate white-box evaluation criteria (Rubrics) based on your data.👉 [Automatic Rubric Generation Tutorial](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/building_graders/generate_graders_from_data/)
* **Training Judge Models ( Coming Soon🚀):** For high-scale and specialized scenarios, we are developing the capability to train dedicated Judge models. Support for SFT, Bradley-Terry models, and Reinforcement Learning workflows is on the way to help you build high-performance, domain-specific graders.


### 🔌 Easy Integration (🚧 Coming Soon)

We're actively building seamless connectors for mainstream observability platforms and training frameworks. Stay tuned! → See [Integrations](#-integrations)

## 📥 Installation

```bash
pip install py-openjudge
```

> 💡 More installation methods can be found in the [Quickstart Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/get_started/quickstart/#installation).

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```python
import asyncio
from openjudge.models import OpenAIChatModel
from openjudge.graders.common.relevance import RelevanceGrader

async def main():
    # 1️⃣ Create model client
    model = OpenAIChatModel(model="qwen3-32b")

    # 2️⃣ Initialize grader
    grader = RelevanceGrader(model=model)

    # 3️⃣ Prepare data
    data = {
        "query": "What is machine learning?",
        "response": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data.",
    }

    # 4️⃣ Evaluate
    result = await grader.aevaluate(**data)

    print(f"Score: {result.score}")   # Score: 5
    print(f"Reason: {result.reason}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Migration Guide (v0.1.x → v0.2.0)
> OpenJudge was previously distributed as the legacy package `rm-gallery` (v0.1.x). Starting from v0.2.0, it is published as `py-openjudge` and the Python import namespace is `openjudge`.

**OpenJudge v0.2.0 is NOT backward compatible with v0.1.x.**
If you are currently using v0.1.x, choose one of the following paths:

- **Stay on v0.1.x (legacy)**: keep using the old package

```bash
pip install rm-gallery
```

We preserved the source code of **v0.1.7 (the latest v0.1.x release)** in the [`v0.1.7-legacy` branch](https://github.com/modelscope/OpenJudge/tree/v0.1.7-legacy).

- **Migrate to v0.2.0 (recommended)**: follow the **[Installation](#-installation)** section above, then walk through **[Quickstart](#-quickstart)** (or the full [Quickstart Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/get_started/quickstart/)) to update your imports / usage.

If you run into migration issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/modelscope/OpenJudge/issues) with your minimal repro and current version.

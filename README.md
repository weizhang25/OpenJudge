OpenJudge is a unified framework designed to drive **LLM and Agent application excellence** through **Holistic Evaluation** and **Quality Rewards**.

> 💡 Evaluation and reward signals are the cornerstones of application excellence. **Holistic evaluation** enables the systematic analysis of shortcomings to drive rapid iteration, while **high-quality** rewards provide the essential foundation for advanced optimization and fine-tuning.

OpenJudge unifies evaluation metrics and reward signals into a single, standardized **Grader** interface, offering pre-built graders, flexible customization, and seamless framework integration.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📦 Systematic & Quality-Assured Grader Library

Access **50+ production-ready graders** featuring a comprehensive taxonomy, rigorously validated for reliable performance.

<table>
<tr>

- 🌐 **Multi-Scenario Coverage:** Extensive support for diverse domains including Agent, text, code, math, and multimodal tasks. 👉  [Explore Supported Scenarios](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/built_in_graders/overview/)
- 🔄 **Holistic Agent Evaluation:** Beyond final outcomes, we assess the entire lifecycle—including trajectories, Memory, Reflection, and Tool Use. 👉  [Agent Lifecycle Evaluation](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/built_in_graders/agent_graders/)
- ✅ **Quality Assurance:** Every grader comes with benchmark datasets and pytest integration for validation. 👉  [View Benchmark Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/agentscope-ai/OpenJudge)


### 🛠️ Flexible Grader Building Methods
Choose the build method that fits your requirements:
* **Customization:** Clear requirements, but no existing grader? If you have explicit rules or logic, use our Python interfaces or Prompt templates to quickly define your own grader.  👉 [Custom Grader Development Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/building_graders/create_custom_graders/)
* **Zero-shot Rubrics Generation:** Not sure what criteria to use, and no labeled data yet? Just provide a task description and optional sample queries—the LLM will automatically generate evaluation rubrics for you. Ideal for rapid prototyping when you want to get started immediately. 👉 [Zero-shot Rubrics Generation Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/building_graders/generate_rubrics_as_graders/#simple-rubric-zero-shot-generation)
* **Data-driven Rubrics Generation:** Ambiguous requirements, but have few examples? Use the GraderGenerator to automatically
summarize evaluation Rubrics from your annotated data, and generate a llm-based grader. 👉 [Data-driven Rubrics Generation Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/building_graders/generate_rubrics_as_graders/#iterative-rubric-data-driven-generation)
* **Training Judge Models:** Massive data and need peak performance? Use our training pipeline to train a dedicated Judge Model. This is ideal for complex scenarios where prompt-based grading falls short.👉 [Train Judge Models](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/building_graders/training_judge_models/)


### 🔌 Easy Integration

Using mainstream observability platforms like **LangSmith** or **Langfuse**? We offer seamless integration to enhance their evaluators and automated evaluation capabilities. We're also building integrations with training frameworks like **verl**. 👉 See [Integrations](#-integrations) for details

## 📥 Installation

```bash
pip install py-openjudge
```

> 💡 More installation methods can be found in the [Quickstart Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/get_started/quickstart/#installation).

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```python
import asyncio
from openjudge.models import OpenAIChatModel
from openjudge.graders.common.relevance import RelevanceGrader

async def main():
    # 1️⃣ Create model client
    model = OpenAIChatModel(model="qwen3-32b")

    # 2️⃣ Initialize grader
    grader = RelevanceGrader(model=model)

    # 3️⃣ Prepare data
    data = {
        "query": "What is machine learning?",
        "response": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data.",
    }

    # 4️⃣ Evaluate
    result = await grader.aevaluate(**data)

    print(f"Score: {result.score}")   # Score: 5
    print(f"Reason: {result.reason}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Migration Guide (v0.1.x → v0.2.0)
> OpenJudge was previously distributed as the legacy package `rm-gallery` (v0.1.x). Starting from v0.2.0, it is published as `py-openjudge` and the Python import namespace is `openjudge`.

**OpenJudge v0.2.0 is NOT backward compatible with v0.1.x.**
If you are currently using v0.1.x, choose one of the following paths:

- **Stay on v0.1.x (legacy)**: keep using the old package

```bash
pip install rm-gallery
```

We preserved the source code of **v0.1.7 (the latest v0.1.x release)** in the [`v0.1.7-legacy` branch](https://github.com/modelscope/OpenJudge/tree/v0.1.7-legacy).

- **Migrate to v0.2.0 (recommended)**: follow the **[Installation](#-installation)** section above, then walk through **[Quickstart](#-quickstart)** (or the full [Quickstart Guide](https://modelscope.github.io/OpenJudge/get_started/quickstart/)) to update your imports / usage.

If you run into migration issues, please [open an issue](https://github.com/modelscope/OpenJudge/issues) with your minimal repro and current version.

# Contribute to OpenJudge

Welcome! OpenJudge is an open-source judge model platform. Your contributions help make AI alignment and evaluation more accessible to the community.

!!! info "Ways to Contribute"
    We welcome contributions of all kinds:

    - **Bug Fixes**: Identify and resolve issues
    - **New Features**: Add graders, training methods, or integrations
    - **Documentation**: Improve guides and examples
    - **Examples**: Share practical use cases and tutorials


## Set Up Development Environment

=== "Step 1: Fork and Clone"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OpenJudge.git
    cd OpenJudge
    ```

=== "Step 2: Install Dependencies"

    ```bash
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    ```

=== "Step 3: Verify Installation"

    ```bash
    python -c "from openjudge.graders.common import RelevanceGrader; print('✓ Installation successful')"
    ```


## Follow Code Standards

!!! tip "Python Coding Standards"
    **Naming:**
    - `snake_case` for functions/variables
    - `PascalCase` for classes
    - `UPPER_CASE` for constants

    **Requirements:**
    - Use type hints for all parameters and returns
    - Include docstrings (Args, Returns, Example)
    - Handle exceptions with context
    - Validate inputs early
    - Optimize for readability


## Testing Guidelines

Before submitting, verify your changes work:

```bash
# Verify installation
python -c "from openjudge.graders.common import RelevanceGrader; print('✓ Works')"

# Run tests (optional)
pytest tests/ -v
```

!!! tip "Testing Guidelines"
    - **Manual testing is recommended** — Test your changes with real examples
    - **Automated tests** — We'll help you add tests during PR review if needed
    - **Focus on functionality** — Make sure your code works for your use case

To ensure the quality and reliability of OpenJudge project, all key components require proper testing. LLMGraders specifically must pass both unit and quality testing.

### Unit Testing

Unit tests verify individual components of your code. Each component should include tests for initialization, successful operation, edge cases, and error handling.

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import AsyncMock
from openjudge.graders.category.grader_module import YourGrader

@pytest.mark.unit
class TestYourGrader:
    def test_initialization(self):
        """Test successful initialization with required parameters"""
        ...

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_successful_operation(self):
        """Test successful operation with valid inputs"""
        ...

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_error_handling(self):
        """Test graceful error handling when dependencies fail"""
        ...
```

All external services (especially LLM APIs) must be mocked to enable offline testing.

### Quality Testing

For LLMGraders, quality testing ensures the grader correctly evaluates response quality by comparing against human annotations or expected standards.

#### Environment Configuration

Quality tests require real API keys and detect them via environment variables:

```python
import os
import pytest

# Check for required environment variables
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
OPENAI_BASE_URL = os.getenv("OPENAI_BASE_URL")
RUN_QUALITY_TESTS = bool(OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_BASE_URL)

# Skip tests if API keys are not configured
@pytest.mark.skipif(not RUN_QUALITY_TESTS, reason="Requires API keys to run quality tests")
@pytest.mark.quality
class TestGraderQuality:
    @pytest.fixture
    def dataset(self):
        """Load dataset for quality testing"""
        ...

    @pytest.fixture
    def model(self):
        """Create a model instance for testing"""
        ...

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_discriminative_power_with_runner(self, dataset, model):
        """Test discriminative power of the model against a dataset"""
        ...

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_consistency_with_runner(self, dataset, model):
        """Test consistency of the model against a dataset"""
        ...
```

## Contributing Graders

When contributing a new grader, follow these guidelines:

### Grader Categories

Place your grader in the appropriate category:

| Category | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Common** | `openjudge/graders/common/` | General-purpose (Relevance, Hallucination) |
| **Agent** | `openjudge/graders/agent/` | Agent evaluation |
| **Code** | `openjudge/graders/code/` | Code evaluation |
| **Format** | `openjudge/graders/format/` | Format validation |
| **Text** | `openjudge/graders/text/` | Text similarity |
| **Multimodal** | `openjudge/graders/multimodal/` | Vision/image |

### Grader Specifications

!!! tip "Grader Requirements"
    **Code:**
    - Inherit from `BaseGrader`
    - Use type hints for all parameters
    - Include clear docstring with usage example
    - Return `GraderScore` with `score` (0.0-1.0) and `reason`
    - Use naming: `MyGrader` (class), `my_grader.py` (file), `"my_grader"` (name)

    **Documentation:**
    - Add to `docs/built_in_graders/` with When to use, Parameters, Scoring criteria, and Example
    - Use `qwen3-32b` as model name in examples

    **Testing:**
    - Manually test your grader works
    - We'll help with automated tests during PR review

### Grader Method Parameter Naming Convention

To ensure consistency and usability, the [aevaluate](../../openjudge/graders/base_grader.py#L71-L116) method of Graders should follow these common parameter naming conventions:

| Parameter Name | Description | Alternative Names (Not Recommended) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | User's original question or instruction | `user_query`, `input_query`, `question`, `instruction` |
| `response` | Model-generated answer or output | `answer`, `generated`, `candidate`, `output`, `generated_text`, `prediction`, `generated_response`, `completion` |
| `reference_response` | Standard answer or expected output | `expected`, `reference` |
| `context` | Additional context required for evaluation | `input`, `input_text`, `text` |
| `tool_definitions` | Available tool definitions list | `tool_definition` |
| `tool_calls` | Actual tool call records | `generated_tool_call` |

### Minimal Grader Template

```python
from openjudge.graders.base_grader import BaseGrader
from openjudge.graders.schema import GraderScore

class MyGrader(BaseGrader):
    """Evaluate [specific aspect].

    Args:
        model: LLM model for evaluation
    """

    def __init__(self, model, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(name="my_grader", **kwargs)
        self.model = model

    async def aevaluate(self, query: str, response: str, **kwargs) -> GraderScore:
        """Evaluate response quality."""
        # Your evaluation logic
        score = 0.8
        reason = "Evaluation explanation"

        return GraderScore(name=self.name, score=score, reason=reason)
```

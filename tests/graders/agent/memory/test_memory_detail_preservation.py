Complete demo test for MemoryDetailPreservationGrader showing unit tests and quality tests.

This file demonstrates two types of tests recommended in the GRADER_TESTING_STRATEGY.md
using MemoryDetailPreservationGrader as an example of LLMGrader:

1. Unit tests (offline testing with mocks)
2. Quality tests (evaluation against real data)

Example:
    Run all tests:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/graders/agent/memory/test_memory_detail_preservation.py -v
    ```

    Run only unit tests:
    ```bash
    pytest tests/graders/agent/memory/test_memory_detail_preservation.py -m unit
    ```

    Run quality tests (only if API keys are configured):
    ```bash
    pytest tests/graders/agent/memory/test_memory_detail_preservation.py -m quality
    ```

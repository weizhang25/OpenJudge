"""Length Penalty Grader Module

This module provides functionality to apply penalties to text based on its length.
It contains the LengthPenaltyGrader class which applies penalties for content
that is either too short or too long according to configured thresholds.

        Calculate length-based penalty for text content.

        This method evaluates the length of the provided text and applies penalties
        if the text is too short or too long according to configured thresholds.

        Penalty calculation:
        - If length < min_length: penalty = -(min_length - length) * penalty_rate
        - If length > max_length: penalty = -(length - max_length) * penalty_rate

            GraderScore: A GraderScore object containing:
                - score: The calculated penalty (negative value or 0.0)
                - reason: Explanation of why the penalty was applied or not
                - metadata: Dictionary with detailed information:
                    * length: Actual length of the text
                    * min_length: Configured minimum length
